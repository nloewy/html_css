<!DOCTYPE html > <!-- this is there always -->
             <!-- note the html interprets sequentially -->
<!-- doctype decloration is needed bc it signals to ur browser that u follow html standard-->
<html> <!-- this tag contains the entire html document-->
    <head> <!-- describes the main content of the page,
                i.e. the title, what character encoding to use, author's description-->
                <meta charset="utf-8"> <!-- note the attribute of the element. space after name -->
                <title>First HTML Page</title> 
                <!-- notice how tags are nested. the head tag contains the title tags.
                     one impt rule is that we need tor close inner tags b4 parent tags-->
    </head>
