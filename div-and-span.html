<!-- content models:
    1. Block Level Elements
        - Render to begin on a new line by default
            - Whenever you specify a block level element, browser places on new line
        - Allowed to contain inline or block level elements within them
    2. Inline Elements
        - Render on the same line (by default)
        - May only contain other inline elements (CANNOT CONTAIN BLOCK LEVEL ELEMENT AS CONTENT)
This renders:
    A 
    B
    C
    D E F 

    This is because div is a block level element, it gets its own line
    Span however is an inline element, so doesnt cause a mandatory new lin

    Recall if you would try to add a div tag within a span tag, it'd be a nissue.
    This is bc spans (phrase) are inline and div is block (flow). cannot have a block inside an inline
