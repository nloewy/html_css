        <p>The rule is simple: last declaration wins.</p> <!-- here we would use the maroon, since it came last. font size is larger too bc it merges-->
        <p style="color: black;">If there is no conflict, declarations merge into one rule.</p>
        <!-- here we'd use black because it overrdes. font size still larger-->
