<!-- sematic html element: applies some meaning to the content

    this is impt bc humans can understand  meanings of content
better when its surrounded by a semantic tag

also may help search engine rankings-->

<!doctype html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Heading Elements</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Main Heading</h1> <!--should truly convey rest of content -->
        <h2>Subheading 2</h2>
        <h3>Subheading 3</h3>
        <h4>Subheading 4</h4>
        <h5>Subheading 5</h5>
        <h6>Subheading 6</h6>
        <!--as you get down in the headings, they get smaller and smaller-->
    <!-- DO NOT USE THE HEADING ELEMENTS FOR STYLING-->
    <!-- if we used these for styling, we'd lose the meaning of what the heading is so use CSS for that-->
    </body>
</html>
