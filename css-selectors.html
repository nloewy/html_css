        <h1>CSS Selectors</h1>
        <h2>About CSS Selectors</h2>
        <p> CSS Selectors are used to determine which html elements or set of elements
            to apply the CSS declarations too. The browser uses the selector API to traverse
            the document element model and pick out the elements matching the selector
        </p>
        <p>
            It's good to be able to write a good selector, as it's also used in javascript as well
        </p>
        <h2>Types of Selectors</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Element Selector</li>
                <div>Says that every element of that type should be styled that way. For example
                    `p{color:blue}`means every paragraph should be colored blue. Div elements 
                    however would not be affected by the rule
                </div>
            <li>Class Selector</li>
                <div>Formatted by `.name` </div>
                <div> 
                    ```css
                    .blue {
                        color: blue;
                    }
                    ```
                </div>
                <div>
                    The above makes a class called blue. Then for each element you
                    want the `blue` class to apply to, we give it that attribute, as shown below
                </div>
                <div>
                    &lt; pclass = "blue" &gt; ... &lt;/p &gt;
                </div>
            <li>ID Selector</li>
                <div>Specify an ID selector by doing a # sign and then the value of an id of an element in the html document </div>
                <div>Example writing an ID selector: </div>
                <div>#name { color:blue;}</div>
                <div>Example using the id selector</div>
                <div>&lt; div id="name" &gt; ... &lt;/div&gt;</div>
        </ol>
        <div>
            We can group selectors by making them many types of selectors:
        </div>
        <div>
            Ex: `div, .blue { color:blue; }
        </div>
    </body>
